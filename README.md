Project Name: Intelligent FAQ-Based Question Answering System with LangChain  This project showcases the power of LangChain in building a robust, AI-driven FAQ-based question-answering system. By combining cutting-edge NLP techniques with vector databases, it efficiently transforms raw FAQ data into a dynamic knowledge repository. Using OpenAI embeddings and FAISS for high-performance similarity search, the system delivers accurate and contextually relevant answers in real-time. The RetrievalQA chain leverages OpenAI's advanced language models to understand user queries and retrieve responses directly from the vector database, ensuring a seamless conversational experience. This scalable solution empowers businesses and developers to build intelligent chatbots that can autonomously handle a wide range of customer queries, enhancing user engagement and reducing manual intervention.
